steps:
- name: Clone the apache maven repository
  kind: shell
  options:
# We don't want to perform a treeless clone here. This is because
# we later make another clone of this repository at output/git_repos/local_repos/maven.
# A clone from output/git_repos/local_repos/maven will have its remote pointing to this
# local path output/git_repos/local_repos/maven. If output/git_repos/local_repos/maven is treeless,
# then any clone from it will not be able to checkout previous commit due to its trees and blobs missing.

# this test locally and running it in the GitHub Actions runner. We only check if the reports are generated as
# expected without the issue described in https://github.com/oracle/macaron/issues/116.
