# This Dockerfile is for building the final production image. It's based on ghcr.io/oracle/macaron-base.
# For the build, two files will be copied into the image:
#   - Macaron wheel file (its path must be provided to the build argument WHEEL_PATH)
#   - user.sh for the entrypoint of the final image.
# For example, using Docker, we could build the image using:
#   docker build --build-arg WHEEL_PATH=<path_to_wheel> -t ghcr.io/oracle/macaron -f docker/Dockerfile.final ./
# Note that the local machine must login to ghcr.io so that Docker could pull the ghcr.io/oracle/macaron-base
# image for this build.
