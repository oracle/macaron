# This is a reuseable workflow to build and test the Docker image. Note that this workflow does not
# push the built Docker image. This reuseable workflow needs two mandatory inputs:
#   artifact-name: The name of the artifact to download. This is the same artifact generated by _build.yaml
#   artifact-sha256: The hash to verify against the downloaded artifact.
