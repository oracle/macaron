# This is a trusted builder implemented as a reusable workflow that can be called by other
# Actions workflows. It checks, tests, and builds the artifacts including SBOM and documentations,
# and computes hash digests as output to be used by a SLSA provenance generator. The artifacts are
# always uploaded for every job to be used for debugging purposes, but they will be removed within
# the specified retention days.
#
# Even though we run the build in a matrix to check against different platforms, due to a known
# limitation of reusable workflows that do not support setting strategy property from the caller
# workflow, we only generate artifacts for ubuntu-latest and Python 3.11, which can be used to
# create a release. For details see:
#
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#limitations
#
# Note: if the build workflow needs to access secrets, they need to be passed by the caller using
# `secrets: inherit`. See also
#
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions
