Macaron Style Guide
===================

Macaron makes use of different linters. These linters are managed using `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ hooks (see the `.pre-commit-config.yaml <https://github.com/oracle/macaron/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml>`_ file). Most styling issues should be caught by pre-commit hooks. However, there are some additional styling rules that we follow.

--------------
Python Modules
--------------

We ban the use of ``__all__`` in ``__init__.py`` files due to known issues with the `sphinx-apidoc`_ docstring generator.

------
Naming
------

We avoid using the same name for two or more classes in all cases (including cases where the two classes are in different modules), due to known issues with the `sphinx-apidoc`_ docstring generator.


----------
Docstrings
----------

We use `sphinx-apidoc`_ to generate :doc:`API Reference </pages/developers_guide/apidoc/index>` automatically from `Python docstrings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ written in the code.

We follow the `numpydoc style <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ for Python docstrings (see `example <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`_) with some exceptions.

''''''''''''''''''''''
Docstrings for classes
''''''''''''''''''''''

Each class should have a docstring written in a triple-quoted block describing the purpose of the class.

For variables of a class: we do not use the ``Attribute`` section as per the `numpydoc style for class docstring <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#class-docstring>`_, due to some known issues with Sphinx. Instead, to document class variables, we follow the following convention:

- For simple Python classes having an ``__init__`` constructor: We document the ``__init__`` constructor like any other regular method, i.e. all parameters should be documented. We do not document `instance variables <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables>`_ and consider them to be private to the class. To expose an instance variable of a class in the documentation, we use `Python property <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property>`_ and document the property methods (``getter``, ``setter``, and ``deleter`` methods) instead. Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    class Point2D:
        """A point in the 2D coordinate system."""

        def __init__(self, coordinate: tuple[float, float]) -> None:
            """Construct a point in the 2D coordinate system.

            Parameters
            ----------
            coordinate : tuple[float, float]
                A pair of x and y coordinates.
            """
            self._x = tuple[0]
            self._y = tuple[1]

        @property
        def x(self) -> float:
            """Get the x coordinate of the point."""
            return self._x

- For Python classes that declare instance variables in class attributes (e.g. :py:class:`typing.NamedTuple`, :py:func:`dataclasses.dataclass`, or `SQLAlchemy ORM Mapped classes <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/mapping_styles.html>`_): We document each instance variable with a comment above the variable prefixed with ``#:`` (if the comment spans more than one line, all lines must be prefixed with ``#:``). Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    from typing import NamedTuple


    class Point2D(NamedTuple):
        """A point in the 2D coordinate system."""

        #: The x coordinate of the point.
        x: float
        #: The y coordinate of the point.
        y: float
