# Defining Checks

The checks defined in this directory are automatically loaded during the startup of Macaron and used during the analysis. For detailed instructions to write a new check, see our [website](https://oracle.github.io/macaron/pages/developers_guide/index.html).


You can also have a look at the existing Checks in [this](./) directory for inspiration.
