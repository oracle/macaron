        ----------

        -------

        """Retrieve the publication timestamp for a package specified by its purl from the deps.dev repository by default.

        This method constructs a request URL based on the provided purl, sends an HTTP GET
        request to fetch metadata about the package, and extracts the publication timestamp
        from the response.

        Note: The method expects the response to include a ``version`` field with a ``publishedAt``
        subfield containing an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.

        Parameters
        ----------
        purl: str
            The Package URL (purl) of the package whose publication timestamp is to be retrieved.
            This should conform to the PURL specification.
        registry_url: str | None
            The registry URL that can be set for testing.

        Returns
        -------
        datetime
            A timezone-aware datetime object representing the publication timestamp
            of the specified package.

        Raises
        ------
        InvalidHTTPResponseError
            If the URL construction fails, the HTTP response is invalid, or if the response
            cannot be parsed correctly, or if the expected timestamp is missing or invalid.
        NotImplementedError
